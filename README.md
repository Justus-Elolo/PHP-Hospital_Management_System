Hospital Management System
Project Overview
The Hospital Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline and automate hospital operations such as patient management, doctor scheduling, appointment booking, billing, and more. This system aims to provide a user-friendly interface and secure handling of patient and hospital data.

Features
Patient Management: Register, edit, and manage patient information, including medical records and appointments.
Doctor and Staff Management: Add and manage doctor schedules, staff profiles, and their roles.
Appointment Scheduling: Book, modify, or cancel appointments between doctors and patients.
Billing Module: Generate invoices for consultations, treatments, and hospital services.
Medical Records: Store and retrieve patient history, diagnoses, prescriptions, and lab results.
Role-Based Access: User management with different access levels for doctors, nurses, administrators, and patients.

Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: PHP (with Laravel or custom framework)
Database: MySQL
Web Server: XAMPP (Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl)
Additional Libraries: jQuery, Bootstrap for UI

Prerequisites
To run the Hospital Management System, you need to install the following:

XAMPP: Download and install XAMPP from here.
PHP: Make sure PHP is included in XAMPP.
MySQL Database: MySQL is bundled with XAMPP, and you’ll be using phpMyAdmin to manage your databases.
Setup Instructions
Download or Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Justus-Elolo/PHP-Hospital_Management_System.git
Move Project to XAMPP Directory Copy the project folder to the htdocs folder inside your XAMPP installation directory, typically located at:

makefile
Copy code
C:\xampp\htdocs\hospital-management-system
Create Database

Open phpMyAdmin by visiting http://localhost/phpmyadmin.
Create a new database named hospital_db.
Import the SQL file located in the database/ directory of the project (e.g., hospital_db.sql) to set up the necessary tables.
Update Database Configuration

Go to the project folder and locate the configuration file for database settings (e.g., config.php or .env in case of Laravel).
Update the following details as per your MySQL credentials:
php
Copy code
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=hospital_db
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=
Start XAMPP

Launch XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache and MySQL modules.
Access the Application

Open your browser and visit http://localhost/hospital-management-system to access the system’s dashboard.
Usage
Login: Use the default credentials for different roles (admin, doctor, staff) to access the respective dashboards.
Admin Panel: Manage patients, doctors, staff, appointments, and billing.
Doctor Panel: View patient records, update medical history, and manage appointments.
Staff Panel: Assist in scheduling and managing patient interactions.
Troubleshooting
Port Issues: If Apache or MySQL fails to start, ensure that no other applications (such as Skype) are using the default ports. You can change Apache's port by editing httpd.conf.
Database Import: If the database import fails, double-check the SQL file for any syntax errors or missing tables.
Future Improvements
Enhanced Security: Add SSL for secure data transmission.
Notifications: Integrate email or SMS notifications for appointment reminders.
Reports: Add a reporting module for generating analytics and performance insights.
